                <p>My name is Ken and I hate ugly webpages. Unfortunately for both me and you, this happens to be one. Oops, sorry about that! I am here to be a developer, not a designer! Well anyways, I enjoy pressing buttons, consuming burritos, and winning Chicken Dinners.</p>
                <p id="mugText">Also since you're here, I might as well show you a funny coffee mug I saw somewhere on the Internet.</p>
